Earlier, you had to use PyTorch container and install packages manually to do this. With the new Hugging Face Deep Learning Containers (DLC) availabe in Amazon SageMaker, the process of training and deploying models is greatly simplified.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this post, we will go through a high level overview of Hugging Face Transformers library before looking at how to use the newly announced Hugging Face DLCs within Sagemaker.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Predicting the playing role of a cricketer using Machine Learning (Part 2)</title><link>https://tmzh.github.io/post/2018-04-28-predicting-the-playing-role-of-a-cricketer-using-machine-learning-part-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Apr 2018 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tmzh.github.io/post/2018-04-28-predicting-the-playing-role-of-a-cricketer-using-machine-learning-part-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the previous &lt;a href="https://tmzh.github.io/machine%20learning/2018/04/23/2018-04-23-predicting-the-playing-role-of-a-cricketer-using-machine-learning-part-1/">post&lt;/a> we saw how to scrape raw data from a content rich webpage. In this post, we will explore how to process that raw data and use Machine Learning tools to predict the playing role of a cricket player just based on his career statistics.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Predicting the playing role of a cricketer using Machine Learning (Part 1)</title><link>https://tmzh.github.io/post/2018-04-23-predicting-the-playing-role-of-a-cricketer-using-machine-learning-part-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Apr 2018 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tmzh.github.io/post/2018-04-23-predicting-the-playing-role-of-a-cricketer-using-machine-learning-part-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this project, we will apply Machine Learning techniques to predict whether a particular cricket player is a batsman or bowler based on his career stats. First we will use Deep Neural Networks (DNN) model and later compare the results with a simpler classifier algorithm such as Random Forest Classifier.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
