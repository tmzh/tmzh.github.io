However, as widespread as they may be, these traditional conversational agents still face certain limitations. While they are excellent in generating conditioned responses, they struggle with out-of-distribution queries. For example, if the user asks an unexpected question or uses unusual patterns, they either revert to a standard response or fail to respond.</description></item><item><title>Create Beautiful Paintings From Rough Sketches Using Stable diffusion</title><link>https://tmzh.github.io/post/2023-05-16-paint-like-bob-ross-using-stable-diffusion/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 May 2023 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tmzh.github.io/post/2023-05-16-paint-like-bob-ross-using-stable-diffusion/</guid><description>Introduction When it comes to creating artwork, there are many Generative AI tools, but my favorite one is the vanilla Stable Diffusion.
