In it, the authors proposes a very clever approach to generate multi-view optical illusions by utilizing text-to-image diffusion models that changes appearance under various transformations such as flips, rotations, and pixel permutations.
Optical illusions such as images that show different subjects under different orientation, ambigrams, etc., Naturally I was quite excited to come across a project called Visual Anagrams that can generate illusions using generative AI.</description></item><item><title>Exploring Retrieval-Augmentated Generation with Open Source Large Language Models</title><link>https://tmzh.github.io/post/2023-06-24-llm-powered-faq-chat-bot/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jun 2023 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tmzh.github.io/post/2023-06-24-llm-powered-faq-chat-bot/</guid><description>Introduction While chatbots have grown common in applications like customer service, they have several shortcomings which disrupts user experience. Traditional chatbots rely on pattern matching and database lookups, which are ineffective when a user&amp;rsquo;s question deviates from what was expected. Responses may feel impersonal and fail to address the true intent when questions deviate slightly from pattern matching rules.
This is where large language models (LLMs) can provide value. LLMs are better equipped to handle out-of-scope questions due to their ability to understand context and previous exchanges.</description></item><item><title>Create Beautiful Paintings From Rough Sketches Using Stable diffusion</title><link>https://tmzh.github.io/post/2023-05-16-paint-like-bob-ross-using-stable-diffusion/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 May 2023 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tmzh.github.io/post/2023-05-16-paint-like-bob-ross-using-stable-diffusion/</guid><description>Introduction When it comes to creating artwork, there are many Generative AI tools, but my favorite one is the vanilla Stable Diffusion. Since it is open source, an ecosystem of tools and techniques have sprouted around it. With it, you can train your own model, fine-tune existing models, or use countless other models trained and hosted by others.
But one of my favorite use case is to render rough sketches into much prettier artwork.</description></item></channel></rss>
