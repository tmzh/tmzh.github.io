Late last year, OpenAI released ChatGPT which was based on GPT-3 but trained using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). And now GPT-4 has been released. It has only been out for a few days, but it is already seeing incredible applications such as creating office documents, turning sketches into functional apps, creating personal tutors, and more.
And not just GPT-based models, StableDiffusion and Dall-E are also pushing the boundaries of art, creating stunning visuals from mere textual descriptions.</description></item></channel></rss>
