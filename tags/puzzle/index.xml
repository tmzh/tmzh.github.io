It became so popular over a while that it was even bought by New York times for a significant sum and is currently &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html">hosted&lt;/a> there. The game is a lot of fun to solve manually, but I am also interested in solving this computationally. This is my attempt at coming up with a solution strategy for the game.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using Constraint Programming Tools to solve an ancient Chinese math puzzle</title><link>https://tmzh.github.io/post/2017-12-09-using-constraint-programming-to-solve-an-ancient-chinese-math-puzzle/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Dec 2017 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tmzh.github.io/post/2017-12-09-using-constraint-programming-to-solve-an-ancient-chinese-math-puzzle/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Constraint_programming">Constraint programming (CP)&lt;/a> is a subset of Operations Research (OR) where our task is to identify all feasible solutions to a given problem that satisfies a set of constraints. This is different from an optimization problem, where an objective function is defined and we arrive at solutions that either maximizes or minimizes an objective function.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>CP is mostly well suited for solving logic puzzles, since most logic puzzles are based on constraints and enumerating feasible solutions. But apart from recreational maths, CP also has a lot of practical applications in Scheduling, Resource allocation, Manufacturing etc.,&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
