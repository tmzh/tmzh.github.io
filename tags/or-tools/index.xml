This is different from an optimization problem, where an objective function is defined and we arrive at solutions that either maximizes or minimizes an objective function.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>CP is mostly well suited for solving logic puzzles, since most logic puzzles are based on constraints and enumerating feasible solutions. But apart from recreational maths, CP also has a lot of practical applications in Scheduling, Resource allocation, Manufacturing etc.,&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
