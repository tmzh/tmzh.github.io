I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure whether it would work with my Linux laptop. But it turned out to be quite simple to setup.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="pre-requisites">Pre-requisites&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The following packages are required:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>bluez&lt;/li>
&lt;li>bluez-utils&lt;/li>
&lt;li>byobu (optional)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Bluez provides the bluetooth protocol stack (most likely shipped with the OS), bluez-utils provides the bluetoothctl utility and byobu is a wrapper around screen terminal emulator. You can also use &amp;lsquo;screen&amp;rsquo; directly. Install these using your distributions recommended procedure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dynamic registration of DNS for Linux devices in an Active Directory environment with Windows DNS server</title><link>https://tmzh.github.io/post/2017-07-19-dynamic-registration-of-dns-for-linux-devices-in-an-active-directory-environment-with-windows-dns-server/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jul 2017 15:43:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tmzh.github.io/post/2017-07-19-dynamic-registration-of-dns-for-linux-devices-in-an-active-directory-environment-with-windows-dns-server/</guid><description>&lt;p>While Linux has proliferated extensively in the server arena in the recent past, Windows still dominates client networks. Things that we take for granted in a client environment such as DDNS (Dynamic DNS) are not as matured as they are in Windows environment. One may wonder whether the recent surge in Linux based clients such as IoT devices has changed this equation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, what does it take to make a Linux client register dynamically in a Windows environment?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
