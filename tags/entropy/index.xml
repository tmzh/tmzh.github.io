It became so popular over a while that it was even bought by New York times for a significant sum and is currently &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html">hosted&lt;/a> there. The game is a lot of fun to solve manually, but I am also interested in solving this computationally. This is my attempt at coming up with a solution strategy for the game.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
