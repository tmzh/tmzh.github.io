## Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) are good at generating coherent text, but they have few inherent limitations:
1. **Hallucinations**: They learn and generate information in terms of likelihood and  may produce information that is not grounded in facts
2. **Knowledge Cutoff**: LLMs are trained on a fixed dataset and do not have access to real-time information or the ability to perform complex tasks like web browsing or executing code.
3. **Abstraction and Reasoning**: LLMs may struggle with abstract reasoning and complex tasks that require logical steps or mathematical operations. Their output is not precise enough for tasks with fixed rule-sets w/o interfacing with external tools

There are two ways to address these limitations: **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **Function Calling**. This post focuses on the latter.

## What is Function Calling?

Function Calling establishes common protocols for LLMs to interact with external tools or APIs, allowing them to supplement their knowledge and capabilities. The below diagam illustrates the process:

This technique helps to overcome the limitations of knowledge cut-off and abstract reasoning, by allowing LLM to plug in to external knowledge sources or tools capable of performing complex tasks.

It may seem that there are many ways to pass function specifications as part of the prompt, but the key is to use an internalized template known by the model.

## Function Calling As A Natural Language Interface

Function calling isn't just for using calculators or calling weather APIs. It can also be used to call backend APIs creating a powerful way to create intuitive natural language interfaces for existing applications. Natural language interfaces are particularly more useful since it allows users to interact with the applications in more than one way. Given the infinite possibilities of user interactions, it's unrealistic for developers to design a UI for every potential scenario. It also eliminates the need for complex UIs, since users can simply ask questions in plain English.

## Example: TMDB Movie Explorer 

I have implemented a simple Flask application both with traditional UI and a Natural Language that uses the function calling mechanism 
This example demonstrates how Function Calling can be used to create a natural language interface for a movie explorer application. 

Scenario: The application is a movie explorer that allows users to query by the cast, the genre, or the title.  But we would like the user to be able to ask in natural language and have the application use the LLM to translate the query into a function call with the necessary arguments. The application should be able to handle all of these queries and return the appropriate information.

### Generate Chain of Thought Reasoning

To handle user queries, we employ a chain of thought (CoT) reasoning approach. This method breaks down the userâ€™s intent into smaller steps, determining the necessary API calls to meet the request.

When a user submits a query, we pass the query to LLM and ask it to generate a reasoning chain that outlines the logical steps required to gather the necessary information. This  involves analyzing the user's request, recognizing relevant functions, and deciding on the order in which these functions should be called. 

```python
def generate_reasoning_chain(user_prompt: str) -> Any:
    messages = [
        {
            "role": "system", 
            "content": "You are a movie search assistant bot who uses TMDB to help users find movies. Think step by step and identify the sequence of reasoning steps that will help to answer the user's query."
        ],
        {"role": "user", "content": user_prompt},
    ]
    return messages
```
For example, if a user asks for movies starring a particular actor, here is the message structure to be used:

```python
[{'role': 'system',
  'content': 'You are a movie search assistant bot who uses TMDB to help users find movies. Think step by step and identify the sequence of function calls that will help to answer.'},
 {'role': 'user', 'content': 'List comedy movies with tom cruise in it'}]
```

To generate the reasoning chain, the LLM also needs to know the list of tools that it has access to. To pass the tool definitions to the LLM, we use the `tools` parameter of the `ChatCompletion.create` method. The tools should be described using JSON Schema and the messages should contain as much available information as possible. Here is an example of tool definition.

```python
tools = [
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "get_movie_details",
            "description": "Get the top level details of a movie by ID",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "movie_id": {
                        "type": "integer",
                        "description": "The ID of the movie to get details for. Use discover_movie to find the ID of a movie.",
                    },
                },
                "required": ["movie_id"],
            },
        },
    },
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "search_person",
            "description": "Search for people in the entertainment industry.",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "query": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "The search query for the person"
                    },
                },
                "required": ["query"]
            }
        }
    }
]
```

We pass this message structure to the LLM to generate a reasoning chain. Here we are using `llama3-groq-70b-8192-tool-use-preview` model from groq which is 70B parameter model that is fine-tuned for tool use.
```python
# Passing the tools to the function
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=MODEL,
    messages=messages,
    tools=tools,
    tool_choice=tool_choice,
    temperature=0,
    max_tokens=4096,
)
```

Here each tool is a python function like below which calls TMDB API to retrieve the data.

```python
def discover_movie(include_adult=False, include_video=False, language="en-US", page=1, sort_by="popularity.desc", **kwargs):
    endpoint = f"{BASE_URL}/discover/movie"
    params = {}

    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        if value is not None:
            params[key] = value
    response = query_tmdb(endpoint, params=params)
    return response
```

Here is an example of the reasoning chain generated for the query "What movies did Tom Hanks star in?"

```python
[
    {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are a movie search assistant bot who uses TMDB to help users find movies. Think step by step and identify the sequence of function calls that will help to answer."
    },
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "List comedy movies with tom cruise in it"
    },
    {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "To find comedy movies with Tom Cruise, I will first need to find the person ID for Tom Cruise using the search_person function. Once I have the person ID, I can use the discover_movie function to find comedy movies that he has been in."
    }
]
```

## Handling Function Calls

The chat method returns a generator of list, each of which may contain multiple messages. Since we passed the tools in the prompt, we should get a list of `tool_calls` in the response:

```python
ChatCompletion(
    id='chatcmpl-e3be35d4-c1e6-4368-b38f-ee556f19a620',
        Choice(
            finish_reason='tool_calls',
            index=0,
            logprobs=None,
            message=ChatCompletionMessage(
                content=None,
                role='assistant',
                function_call=None,
                tool_calls=[
                    ChatCompletionMessageToolCall(
                        id='call_p11f',
                        function=Function(
                            arguments='{"query": "Tom Hanks"}',
                            name='search_person'
                        ),
                        type='function'
                    )
                ]
            )
        )
    ],
    created=1733275334,
    model='llama3-groq-70b-8192-tool-use-preview',
    object='chat.completion',
    system_fingerprint='fp_ee4b521143',
    usage=CompletionUsage(
        completion_tokens=26,
        prompt_tokens=901,
        total_tokens=927,
        completion_time=0.080189063,
        prompt_time=0.059023546,
        queue_time=0.0008997029999999948,
        total_time=0.139212609
    ),
    x_groq={'id': 'req_01je7m5dnae2h9xtnxcf36bbc2'}
)
```

The details related to tool calls are placed in the `function` field of the messages:
* **name**: a string representing the function to call
* **arguments**: a JSON-formatted string representing the arguments the function should be called with

For example in the above response, the function name to call is `search_person` and the arguments are `{"query": "Tom Hanks"}`.

We can extract the function name and arguments from the response and call the function. The function's response is then added to the conversation history.

```python
if response.choices[0].finish_reason == "tool_calls":
    tool_calls = response.choices[0].message.tool_calls
    new_messages = messages.copy()
    for tool_call in tool_calls:
        tool_result = execute_tool(tool_call)
        new_messages.append(
            {
                "tool_call_id": tool_call.id,
                "role": "tool",
                "name": tool_call.function.name,
                "content": str(tool_result),
            }
        )
```

Including both the function call and its response is crucial. The LLM relies solely on the conversation history; without context, a standalone response (like "28") is meaningless. However, paired with the preceding call ("Search for genre: comedy"), the response becomes informative and improves the user experience.

Now the message would be like:

```python
[{'role': 'system',
  'content': 'You are a movie search assistant bot who uses TMDB to help users find movies. Think step by step and identify the sequence of function calls that will help to answer.\n        Do not call multiple functions when they need to be executed in sequence. Only call multiple functions when they can be executed in parallel. Stop with a discover_movie function call that returns a list of movie ids'},
 {'role': 'user', 'content': 'List some movies of Tom hanks'},
 {'role': 'assistant',
  'content': 'To find movies of Tom Hanks, I will first need to find the person ID of Tom Hanks using the search_person function. Once I have the person ID, I can use the discover_movie function to find movies that he has been in.'},

We recursively call functions recommended by the language model until we reach the `discover_movies` function. At each iteration we execute those calls and assimilate the responses back into the prompt. The final `discover_movies` call consolidates all the gathered parameters and data into a single request that retrieves the ultimate list of movies relevant to the user's inquiry.

```python
def generate_domain_knowledge(messages, count=0):
    response = get_response(client, MODEL, messages, tool_choice="required")
    if response.choices[0].finish_reason == "tool_calls":
        tool_calls = response.choices[0].message.tool_calls
        new_messages = messages.copy()
        for tool_call in tool_calls:
            tool_result = execute_tool(tool_call)
            if tool_call.function.name == "discover_movies":
                return tool_result['results']
            else:
                new_messages.append(
                    {
                        "tool_call_id": tool_call.id,
                        "role": "tool",
                        "name": tool_call.function.name,
                        "content": str(tool_result),
                    }
                )
        if count < 2:
            generate_domain_knowledge(new_messages, count + 1) # stop at 2 recursive calls

## Lessons learnt and Caveats

Keep in mind that the limitation and the perks of prompt engineering applies:
- Keep the function calls simple and concise. The more complex the function calls, the more likely it is that the model will make mistakes.
- Function parameter validation is not handled by the model. It is up to the developer to ensure that the parameters are valid.
- Establish Guardrails to prevent the model from calling functions that it should not call

Remember that the model is just one component of the system. Its effectiveness and safety depend on how it's used and integrated into the broader context. It's the responsibility of the developer to tailor safety measures to their specific use case and to ensure that the model's outputs are safe and appropriate for the context.
